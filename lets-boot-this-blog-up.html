                    <h3 id="power-switch">Power Switch:</h3>

<p>Many of you reading this first post of the blog‚Äôd know me still let me make an informal introduction of myself - of course in my own way. üòõ</p>

<h3 id="bios">BIOS:</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm Biprodeep Roy, a computer geek, cyber security hobbist, science addict, nature lover, music creator and a logical spiritualist (in which nationalism is included üòã). I believe in a perfect balanced between nature and technology where one acts as a constructive conjugate to another.  PS: Just know me as your regular seriously sarcastic guy. üòú</p>

<h3 id="preboot-loader">Preboot Loader:</h3>

<p>I was introduced into programming when I was 8 years old (don‚Äôt worry just some LOGO and GWBasic sh!t üòõ ). Then by the time I was 11, I could code basics in Q-Basic, VB and C and then eventually C++/VAJA/blah-blah as the years went by . . .</p>

<h3 id="boot-loader">Boot Loader:</h3>

<p>Previously till 15, I was more interested in physics than in Computer Science (CS) although I kept learning more in both of the subjects. Oh BTW - I was introduced to Linux when I was 13 - let me tell you this story in brief. I had just joined my first computer tutor and he was a researcher in CS at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). He used to use Ubuntu for his daily chores, and by that time I was already curious about computers so used to wonder what OS it was - because it looked different. One fine day I asked him the name of the OS and he was like, ‚Äú Its ‚ÄòOOOBooNTTu‚Äô nigga‚Äù! - I was completely shocked by the name itself and then he said its based on ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt catch ‚ÄúViiirushes‚Äù - that made me way more curious. Those days we didn‚Äôt have internet as a regular feature. People generally used to use DialUP BSAN*L modems with sh!tty connections to connect to the Internet. I remember that time we used to have only 1 cyber cafe with slow internet in our region and that too filled with lame kids who wasted it playing GTA ViceCity sh!t. Fortunately my computer sir had an internet connection, so I asked him to give me the installation image for ubuntu and he gave it to me in a CD in which he had burnt it for me. I was only a regular wAnBLoWs guy who used to code and listen to music on an offline PC that was gifted to me by my uncle back when I was 12 years old. Note: I hated and still now hate playing games because it makes me go dizzy. Now when I went and tried installing that Ubuntu - I saw the installer and I was pretty happy because it had the ‚Äúnext‚Äù button just like every wANbLoWs software installer ‚ÄúwiZZards‚Äù. I gave the installer what it wanted and when selecting partitions I went will clean install without understanding how it works - the installation went smoothly but when I rebooted my PC - to my shock wAnBLoWs disappeared deleting all other data on the machine - I was kinda in a dead state when I had a feeling that I was trapped in a locked room with a hungry beast inside it. But from the next day I started exploring OOOBooNTTu and could find it pretty good. That way I got into Linux and the ignition was done by my sir!</p>

<h3 id="kernel">Kernel:</h3>

<p>I got into security wondering around and just being a curious n00b. Previously it was hax0ring for me, then it became hacking, then discovering bugs, then innovating methodologies, then security and now its creativity.</p>

<h3 id="init-system">Init System:</h3>

<p>I had a previous blog when I was around 18 or 19 but that blog eventually died because I didn‚Äôt want to maintain it. I was kinda busy in learning new things after that so didn‚Äôt find anytime to continue it, and it just got wiped up.</p>

<h3 id="runlevel-services">Runlevel Services:</h3>

<p>Even now I don‚Äôt have time for blogging but with coming days a LOT of people are demanding and requesting blog posts, I will try to squeeze out some time and scribble some sh!t up here, cannot promise that it will be quality stuff always.</p>

<h3 id="user-shell">User Shell:</h3>

<p>I hope you will enjoy my posts and share them if you like it, also I will be very colloquial and frank with my language, cause I believe in the freedom to express myself freely üòõ ( I do not require to use this as my professional profile cause I have faith in my skills more, than just some scribbling on some temporary page). So, let this blog begin!</p>
